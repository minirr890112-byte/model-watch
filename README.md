## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/minirr890112-byte/HermesMade.git#subdirectory=model-watch
```

Or from local:

cd HermesMade/model-watch && pip install .
```

## Usage

```bash
# View benchmark questions
model-watch demo

# Submit model outputs (from your API calls)
model-watch submit '{"reasoning_1":"...", "coding_1":"...", ...}'

# View score history
model-watch history

# Check for degradation alerts
model-watch alert
```

## Benchmarks

7 standardized tests covering:
- Reasoning (2 tests)
- Coding (2 tests)
- Writing (1 test)
- Instruction following (1 test)
- Hallucination detection (2 tests)

## How it works

1. Run the 7 benchmark questions through your AI model of choice
2. Feed the responses into `model-watch submit`
3. Scores are stored locally in `~/.hermes/model-watch-history.json`
4. Track trends with `model-watch history`
5. `model-watch alert` flags when recent scores drop >10% vs historical average
